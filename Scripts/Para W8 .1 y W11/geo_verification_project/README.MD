# Geo Verification Project

This project verifies the integrity of directory structures and tracks geo-locations. It logs events and handles directory verification results. Alerts are sent based on the findings:
- **True**: Indicates non-permitted directories were found.
- **False**: Indicates everything is as expected or specific actions have been taken (like executing a recovery script).
